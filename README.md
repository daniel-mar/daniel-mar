Add dynamic use with JavaScript modules (Papa Parse), allowing for reading of .csv file and generating the table headers and body accordingly. I would like to load the .csv with the page load, or create a dashboard to view multiple files at the same time.
- Scraping the data and displaying the reformatted data in a dynamic table, similar to viewing with pandas as a dataframe. Allows for uploading custom .csv files and viewing your data on a website.
