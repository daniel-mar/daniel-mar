### Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Martinez. A home-remodelor, painter and carpenter turned full stack developer! I strive towards continued growth, learning and becoming a first-generation software engineer!
### Graduated Coding Dojo's Full Stack Software Development coding bootcamp! Familiarized myself in 3 stacks; Python, C# and MERN!
#### I am looking forward to expanding my growth provided by my next immersive software engineering coding boot camp to step out of my comfort zone in order to expand my skillset in DevOps, testing and Java + Spring boot development. Very ecstatic about continuing to follow my curiosity and become an overall better software engineer!
#### I have hosted study sessions & debugging via Zoom with my cohort mates at Coding Dojo following our bootcamp lectures and on the weekends as well.
#### My goal is to continously show up for my future self, understanding that this is a marathon of continous education.

### Github repos are being decluttered and reorganized as of June 29, 2022! I will be learning more about different types of project deployment / hosting along side of Machine Learning / AI. I will include actively online and previewable links below.

#### Here are a collection of projects that I've developed throughout my software development journey!

- âš¡ Fun facts about me:
- I get a kick out of finding more efficient ways in doing repetitive tasks. Especially when I am gardening!

- "The more I learn about full stack development & engineering, The more I realize that there is plenty left to learn!"

- I truly love being able to continously learn & progress in software development. I know I do not know everything there is today, but it is having that understanding that I know by putting in the effort into learning and creating every day, that I will become a great engineer in this marathon of life.

# Python Fullstack Development

### Scraping to HTML
- Project goal: One of two projects made in project week, modularize an application in order scrape and display data in a custom website. Practice processing data and pushing to a website to create a custom display of data.
- Route uses a class that stores scraping information, collects data and display within HTML in Jinja3.

### Scraping data and displaying online
- Project goal: After collecting data and exporting to .csv. Add dynamic use with JavaScript modules (Papa Parse), allowing for reading of .csv file and generating the table headers and body accordingly. I would like to load the .csv with the page load, or create a dashboard to view multiple files at the same time.
- Scraping the data and displaying the reformatted data in a dynamic table, similar to viewing with pandas as a dataframe. Allows for uploading custom .csv files and viewing your data on a website.

### Premiere League Scraper: Repository
- Project goal: To collect relavent data and use good practices in collecting of data accurately for data analysis use. 
- Scrapes HTML for league leaderboard statistics. Processed, cleaned and organized data for ease of use in data analysis. Recently added option for exporting data to .CSV format.

### Users CRUD: Repository with GIF demonstration.
- Project goal: Full stack development, from ERD diagram concept to building the front end and back end.
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja, MySQL. Practice concepts for modularized full stack development to prepare for MERN stack.
- To continue this project, I may consider a login & validation.

### Part Manager: Repository
- Project goal: To learn about databases, practice full stack development and what to consider when storing web scraped data.
- Created a small CRUD application. GUI for managing of an exportable part database to keep track of prices from different retailers. 

# Frontend Development

### REACT Portfolio Landing Page
##### https://github.com/daniel-mar/react-landing-page
- Project goal: Display the understanding and growth from Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS into incorporating it all with REACT's javascript library.
- Simple landing page that leads to my different social medias.

### Graduation Countdown Timer
- Project goal: Manipulate and update the HTML elements. Create a days, hours countdown timer between current time and my coding bootcamp graduation.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Used JavaScript for calculating and outputting the difference between a target time and current time. I use this as a reminder to continue perservering through interviews. I can and will be a great software engineer and know I will be recognized for my potential. Until then, keep going, keep having fun, and keep showing up.

### Weather Converter
##### https://daniel-mar.github.io/dojo-weather/index.html
- Project goal: Create a website in vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript that has default values within a mock city, to utilize functionality of JavaScript to convert values between Fahrenheit and Celcius. Plus practice in wireframe layouts with bootstap.
