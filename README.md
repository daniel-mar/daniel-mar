### Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I am Daniel Martinez Paiz, previously a home-remodelor, painter and carpenter turned first-generation software engineer! I am searching for the ability to gain professional software engineering experience with a team that loves to mentor and grow together so that I can continue to grow my skillset and help our team progress further!

# Python Fullstack Development
### Scraping data and displaying online
https://github.com/daniel-mar/full_stack_scrape
- Project goal: After collecting data and exporting to .csv. Add dynamic use with JavaScript modules (Papa Parse), allowing for reading of .csv file and generating the table headers and body accordingly. I would like to load the .csv with the page load, or create a dashboard to view multiple files at the same time.
- Scraping the data and displaying the reformatted data in a dynamic table, similar to viewing with pandas as a dataframe. Allows for uploading custom .csv files and viewing your data on a website.

### Recipes/Users CRUD
