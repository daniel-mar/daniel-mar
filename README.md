### Users CRUD: Repository with GIF demonstration.
- Project goal: Full stack development, from ERD diagram concept to building the front end and back end.
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja, MySQL. Practice concepts for modularized full stack development to prepare for MERN stack.
- To continue this project, I may consider a login & validation.

### Part Manager: Repository
- Project goal: To learn about databases, practice full stack development and what to consider when storing web scraped data.
- Created a local CRUD application. GUI for managing of an exportable (.csv) parts database to keep track of prices from different retailers. 

# Frontend Development

### REACT Portfolio Landing Page

### Graduation Countdown Timer
- Project goal: Manipulate and update the HTML elements. Create a days, hours countdown timer between current time and my coding bootcamp graduation.
