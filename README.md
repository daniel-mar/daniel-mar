### Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Martinez. A residential & commercial painter turned self taught full stack developer with the goal to be an engineer!
### Attending an immersive software development bootcamp to step out of my comfort zone in order to expand my skillset, continue to follow my curiosity and become an overall better developer.
#### I host study sessions & debugging via Zoom with my cohort mates following our bootcamp lectures and on the weekends as well.
#### My goal is to continously show up for my future self, understanding that this is a marathon of continous education. I have dedicated over 80-90 hours per week towards my bootcamp and everything software development.

#### Here are a collection of projects that I've developed throughout my software development journey!

- âš¡ Fun facts about me:
- I get a kick out of finding more efficient ways in doing repetitive tasks. Especially when I am gardening!

- "The more I learn about full stack development & engineering, The more I realize that there is plenty left to learn!"

- I truly love being able to continously learn & progress in software development. I know I do not know everything there is today, but it is having that understanding that I know by putting in the effort into learning and creating every day, that I will become a great engineer in this marathon of life.
